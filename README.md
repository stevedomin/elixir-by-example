# Elixir By Example

## What's this?

This is the source for the [Elixir by Example](http://elixirbyexample.com) website.

The concept was shamelessly copied from [Rust by Example](http://rustbyexample.com). Congrats to the
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) team for doing a fantastic job with this guide to the language.
