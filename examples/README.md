# Elixir By Example

[Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable
applications.

Elixir leverages the [Erlang VM](http://www.erlang.org/), known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant
systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain.

To get Elixir installed on your computer you can follow [this guide](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

It might be useful to have [the Elixir documentation](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/) opened while you follow this guide.
